# Gamification of Behavioural Experiments (REUPLOAD FROM PRIVATE REPO WITH PERMISSION FROM PO)

Welcome to the gamification of behavioural experiments project, created by SOFTENG 761 Team 10 students from The University of Auckland.

## Introduction

Do you want to run gamified behavioural experiments?

The project involves the creation of a web application where researchers can create and share a customised game. Actions by the game user will be logged and sent to the database, where researchers can view, download, and perform analysis on human learning behaviour.
